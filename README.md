## 🌐 Personal Portfolio Website

This is the source code for my personal portfolio website, [carlosdbonilla.com](https://carlosdbonilla.github.io/cdb-website/), built entirely from scratch using [Pelican](https://getpelican.com/), a static site generator written in Python.

The goal of this project was to create a lightweight, fast, and fully customized professional presence online — without relying on any templates or site builders.
